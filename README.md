# Result Pattern in C#

This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of the Result pattern in C#. The Result pattern provides a structured approach to represent the outcome of an operation, encapsulating both success and failure states in a clear and concise manner.

## Introduction

In modern software development, handling errors and ensuring robust code is paramount. One effective way to achieve this is by using the Result pattern. This pattern provides a structured approach to represent the outcome of an operation, encapsulating both success and failure states.

## What is the Result Pattern?

The Result pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates the result of an operation, including both the success and failure states. It typically consists of:
•  [**Success Indicator**](https://github.com/alisadri1993/ResultPattern/blob/master/ResultPattern/Abstraction/Result.cs): A boolean flag indicating whether the operation was successful.

•  [**Value**](https://github.com/alisadri1993/ResultPattern/blob/master/ResultPattern/Abstraction/Result.cs): The result of the operation if it was successful.

•  [**Error**](https://github.com/alisadri1993/ResultPattern/blob/master/ResultPattern/Abstraction/Result.cs): Information about the error if the operation failed.


## Why Use the Result Pattern?

The Result pattern offers several benefits:
•  **Clarity**: It makes it explicit when a method can fail and what kind of errors can occur.

•  **Error Handling**: Encourages handling errors explicitly, improving code robustness.

•  **Readability**: Reduces the need for try-catch blocks, making the code more readable and maintainable.

•  **Consistency**: Provides a consistent way to handle errors across your codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.


## Implementing the Result Pattern in C#

```csharp
public class Result<T>
{
public bool IsSuccess { get; }
public T Value { get; }
public string Error { get; }

protected Result(bool isSuccess, T value, string error)
{
IsSuccess = isSuccess;
Value = value;
Error = error;
}

public static Result<T> Success(T value) => new Result<T>(true, value, null);
public static Result<T> Failure(string error) => new Result<T>(false, default, error);
}

Using the Result Pattern
Here's an example of how you can use the Result pattern in your methods:

public Result<int> Divide(int numerator, int denominator)
{
if (denominator == 0)
{
return Result<int>.Failure("Division by zero is not allowed.");
}

return Result<int>.Success(numerator / denominator);
}

Example Usage
var result = Divide(10, 2);

if (result.IsSuccess)
{
Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result.Value}");
}
else
{
Console.WriteLine($"Error: {result.Error}");
}

Without Using the Result Pattern
To better understand the benefits of the Result pattern, let's look at how the same functionality would be implemented without it, using traditional exception handling:

public int Divide(int numerator, int denominator)
{
if (denominator == 0)
{
throw new ArgumentException("Division by zero is not allowed.");
}

return numerator / denominator;
}

try
{
var result = Divide(10, 2);
Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
}
catch (ArgumentException ex)
{
Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
}
